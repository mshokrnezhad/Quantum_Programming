Welcome to the Quantum_Programming repository! This repo includes introductory lectures about quantum theory and quantum computing/programming, as well as some coding examples to run simple quantum algorithms using quantum simulators and real quantum computers.

These materials were gathered during a 2-day course at [CSC](https://csc.fi/en/). You can view my certificate [here](certificate.pdf). CSC offers a comprehensive GitHub repository on quantum computing which you can access [here](https://github.com/FiQCI).

Quantum computing is a fascinating field. I plan to further my studies on this topic and will update this repository with more practical and advanced codes in the future.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mshokrnezhad/quantum_programming.git
   cd quantum_programming
   ```

2. **Explore the Lectures**: The lecture materials can be found in the `Lectures` directory.

3. **Run the Coding Examples**: Navigate to the `Samples` directory to find and run the coding examples. Instructions for each example are provided in the respective directories.

## Prerequisites

To run the coding examples, you will need:

- A Python environment (version 3.6 or higher recommended)
- Quantum computing libraries such as Qiskit. You can install it using:
  ```bash
  pip install qiskit
  ```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or additional examples to share, please feel free to create a pull request.
